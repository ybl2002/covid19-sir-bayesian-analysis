COVID-19 SIR Model Bayesian Analysis
A comprehensive implementation of Bayesian inference for the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemiological model applied to COVID-19 data, featuring both MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and SMC (Sequential Monte Carlo) methods.
Features

Dual Bayesian Approaches: Implementation of both fixed-parameter MCMC and time-varying SMC methods
Custom MCMC Sampler: Self-implemented Metropolis-Hastings algorithm without external MCMC libraries
Sequential Monte Carlo: Particle filter implementation for tracking time-varying transmission rates
Comprehensive Diagnostics: Autocorrelation analysis, effective sample size calculation, and convergence diagnostics
Professional Visualizations: Publication-ready figures including posterior distributions, time series, and method comparisons
Complete Analysis Pipeline: From data preprocessing to final report generation
